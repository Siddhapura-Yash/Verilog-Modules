# Verilog-Modules
A collection of digital designs using Verilog, each folder containing a different hardware component to explore and understand VLSI concepts.

I am using Quartus II 8.1 Web Edition for simulation, so a testbench is not necessary.
I have also used Vivado for some modules, where I uploaded the testbench.
